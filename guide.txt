★★★ How should I build my account when I first create it?★★★

First of all, when you first create an account, just keep clearing chapters until you reach castle level 21.
The reason is because at level 21, the number of operable troops increases to 5+1.

What does 5+1 mean?
5 = Troops that can gather, hunt, support alliance buildings and structures
(Special thing is they can move to another gathering point after finishing gathering while returning)
1 = The troop in the small green square in the top right corner -> Can only gather
(Special thing is they cannot stop after finishing gathering and returning)

★★★ Which heroes should I raise?★★★

First, there are various types of heroes.
Hunting / Gathering / Combat / Arena / Field Battle / Monster Subjugation and so on, there are too many.
There are so many that it's difficult for me to explain them all, but I will do my best to explain to the maximum.

First, basic knowledge is that heroes can equip officers after reaching level 20 and promoting to 3 stars.
Main hero: Both skills and talents apply
Sub hero: Only skills apply
Please keep the above information in mind.

As I mentioned before, you really have to raise all heroes.
But heroes that are rarely used: Kainess, Mua
Heroes to start raising: All except above
Heroes to raise until the end: Kallope, Janette, Haemosu, Jangseung, 7 gathering heroes, Kaila (for move speed), Eren (best cost efficient defensive hero)

★★★ How should I distribute hero talents?★★★

Many people are curious about this part.
I'm not very good at explaining, but I will do my best.

1. Gathering heroes
   Looking at Kaya's skills, there are skills related to ore and food.
   Based on that, when distributing talents, focus on food and ore, and reach the final gathering amount talent.
   So level 35 is sufficient.
   But if you want to go all the way to the end, there is a gathering speed talent among the upper talents, if you reach level 44 and distribute points into that as well, level 44 will be the end.
   Distribute gathering hero talents in this way.

1. Combat heroes

1) First compare the talents at the very end of the upper and lower talent lines.

1) After choosing one, choose one talent to raise in each section of that line, and only raise it by 3 levels before moving on to the next section.

1) Afterwards, do the other line in the same way until you get the talents at the very end.

1) Stat sections

- Infantry - Defense
- Cavalry - Attack or Health
- Archers - Attack

5. For heroes with exceptionally powerful active skills, raise talent related to skills.

3) Special notes
1) Kaila: She is the hero with the fastest speed, so raise all talents related to march speed in talents.
1) Jangseung: There are some heroes specialized in mana like Jangseung. In their talents there are many mana related talents.
   Think of these heroes as so-called skill spammers, they are great paired with heroes that have powerful active skills.
1) You can raise them differently depending on the situation. For example with Secmeth, if you plan to hunt for a while, you can raise hunting related talents in talents, and if you plan to war, change to attack     related ones. 
   You can adjust well according to the situation.

★★★ What is the proper direction for construction and research?★★★

1. Construction
   The castle is basic, rush the castle to level 21 first, then you can take it slowly afterwards.
   From now on, make sure the castle level and hospital and castle wall levels are the same.

2. Research
   For research, tier upgrade comes first.
   Honestly getting to tier 4 is easy, tier 5 is questionable whether it's possible in this life.
   So for us free players, raise it to tier 4 first, then master the economy aspects.
   Farming is our hope after all.

※ For construction and research, be sure to patiently accumulate strength until a proper event comes.
Such events come more often than you think.

★★★ Small but useful tips★★★
I will write randomly as I think of them..

▶1
Don't fill up action points, after filling up, immediately use some for hunting.
Natural recovery doesn't happen when full.

▶2
Make it a habit to stockpile everything except gacha prayer items.

Events like gathering / hunting monsters / raising research and construction contribution / training soldiers happen frequently, so
unload everything you've stockpiled when they happen to rank high and get better rewards.

▶3
When doing construction, research, training, you can get help from alliance members, make sure to get all help before using accelerators or waiting.

▶4
Control tips for world map.
PC: Double click troop in top right corner or press ctrl + a to select all troops.
You can select troops with ctrl + 1~5, then you can move troops and attack using drag or right click.

Mobile: Double click troop in top right to select all troops.
(Only troops in the current screen)

▶5
When hunting monsters, if another monster passing by gets aggroed by our hero's AOE skill, even if that monster dies, you still get exp. But action points are consumed. (Herd hunting possible)

▶6
Things like Arena and Monster Subjugation reset every day at 9am.
So for maximum benefit, participate right before 9am.
(Tomorrow's "me" is stronger than today's "me

▶7
It is essential to join an alliance.
If possible, join a strong alliance to receive benefits from paying members.

▶8
When healing troops at the hospital, try not to use help from alliance members too much. 
Look at the thermometer in the top left - if you use help too much, the nurses get overloaded and the hospital goes into overload, preventing you from getting alliance help when you really need it later.

▶9
When special packages pop up, look at the color - red means definitely buy, yellow means can consider buying. As free players, do not buy anything else.

▶10
The port comes at 3am and 9am daily - buy all resources available for gems there. Can also consider buying 80-90% resources or accelerators.

▶11
In the VIP shop, buy all resources available for gems as well. The 8hr accelerators for 240 diamonds are very efficient, worth buying.

▶12
When hunting monsters, prepare heroes that are all single target damagers or without AOE skills. Having AOE heroes makes things annoying.

▶13
When climbing the tower, a common tactic is to use a fast cavalry hero like Kaila to attract a lot of aggro while running around. 
Have the other heroes kill all the non-boss enemies, then everyone attacks the boss together.

▶14
Gems don't have much use, but investing them into VIP is highly recommended.
VIP8 lets you select 1 hero aptitude stone daily.
VIP11 gives 2 free hero aptitude stones daily - insane!

▶15
 For talents, you need to be able to max out both the top and bottom lines.
 At level 59, raise each section by 3 levels before moving on to reach the talents at the very ends on both lines.

▶16 ★★★★★(Important)
 When hunting monsters, 5 troops vs 1 monster is much more efficient than 1 troop vs 1 monster.
 If 1 monster gives 100 exp, with 5 troops focused on 1 monster, each troop gets 100 exp - so 5x more.
 Action points consumed is also 5x more. But it greatly reduces fight time and casualties, so long term it is very beneficial. Rewards also multiply by troop number.

▶17
 Don't upgrade recruited soldiers you already have - they become very useful in wars. Keep them for gathering too. But don't intentionally recruit more.

▶18
 This tip is for alliance leaders - when doing Aktarus events, you can use rally.
Make all cavalry
Set rally time to 5min
Rally the Aktarus closest to your castle
Re-rally returning troops instead of letting them return
Kick out alliance members if they have a lot of march time left
Aktarus is on UTC time (+9 hours for Korea)
 Only use event stones to level Aktarus skills.

▶19
 Passes are very important - if your troops and castle are separated by a pass, they cannot return without dying or using certain lord skills.

▶20
 Only use gathering aptitude stones for Kaya and Natalie's skills.

▶21
 After world map opens, zoom out fully and click the globe button bottom right to visit other servers and migrate kingdoms.

▶22
 Alliance members can support building captures and upgrades. Up to 2 million troops can be sent, more support shortens capture time. 
Lots of support greatly aids alliance growth.

▶23
 Buying the $15 season pass at Larrie's manor is very efficient, recommend it.
▶24
 If mines or embassies don't appear at first while clearing chapters, don't panic and just ignore them - they will unlock naturally later.

▶25
 Gathering speed is increased by 25% in alliance territory towers. So best not to allow many player castles near towers, to allow more gathering plots to respawn.

▶26
 Commonly used lord skills:
Arthur (Extra attack)
Natalie (Force return all troops)
Finn (Force return selected troop)
Aktarus (Reduce damage taken from monsters)

▶27
 Something at Larrie's manor, if buying the $15 pack do it early for extra exp bonus. So you get higher level, get better rewards.

▶28 ★★★★★(Important)
 Field bosses:
 Zone 1: Binzy / Level 1 Inferno
 Zone 2: Bit / Steve / Level 2 Inferno
 Zone 3: Level 3 Inferno

These give very juicy rewards. You must hunt them. As mentioned, using multiple troops multiples rewards. 
Raid these on time with a good alliance. This is the only way for free players to compete with payers.

▶29
 When hunting, only prepare single target damage heroes without AOE skills. AOE skills make things messy.

▶30
 About titans - at 180k power they unlock naturally. But the cavalry titan Edock starts badly injured. 
Use cavalry materials from the titan workshop to heal him. You'll need about 10-15 half health titans to beat level 1 Inferno bosses later.

▶31
 For alliance missions - leaders can assign them daily at 9am after reset. Pick missions that align with ongoing events for simultaneous progress. 
Avoid fortress assaults without events as they usually won't get done. Set missions involving territory towers or temple captures when those events are happening for lots of support.

▶32
 About rally - some buildings like monster fortresses require rally to attack together, since difficult for one player. 
Any alliance member can initiate a rally, others can join and support with matching troop types. Damaged rally troops can be reinforced by sending same troop type. This is called "refueling".

▶33
 The Bonion event lasts around 4 days. There are stages with increasing rewards. You just need to clear your highest stage once in the 4 days, then can progress further in the next event. Most efficient to use 1 troop until stuck, then rally for help. 
No real shortcuts, just use your max operable troops to clear stages.

▶34 ★★★★★(Important)
 The Apex Predator event is the biggest - 5 days of competing in different categories, with total score determining final rewards, which include Elisha aptitude stones. 
Even lower ranks get some, but need top 15 to get enough for a chance at her soulstone. 
Save accelerators, resources, training, research, and alliance accelerators for a big push when ready - around 200-300 days of each stockpiled. 
Payers just recruit on day 1 for easy 1st place. For free players, decide if top 15 is viable then push hard if so.
